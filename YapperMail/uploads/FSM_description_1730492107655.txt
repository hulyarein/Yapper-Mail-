I designed a Finite state machine for a turn based game. I called the game Card Fight. It as a turn based game which allows you to pick a character and have a match with a computer. You and the computer will take turns picking a move and the first one to reach an hp of 0 will lose the match. There will be three matches in total. The one with the highest number of wins will win the whole game.
